# CM Copy List – Chrome Extension
A minimal Chrome extension that adds one-click “copy card info” buttons to the Cardmarket website, letting you export the exact contents of a wants list as plain text.



## 🚀 What it does
| Feature             | Where it appears                                       | What it copies                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **“Copy All”**      | Next to the **“Add to list”** button on any wants table view | Every card in the list in the format:`<Amount> <Card Name> (<Expansion>)`     |
| **Row-by-row copy** | Right next to the trash-can icon on each row           | The same single-line format for just that card                                |

## 📦 Installation
- Download or clone this repository.
- Open chrome://extensions in Chrome.
- Enable Developer mode (toggle in the top-right).
- Click “Load unpacked” and select the extension folder.
- Visit any Cardmarket page and go to your Wants.
- Enjoy the new copy buttons!

  ## Why?
Because sharing lists between users while keeping the exact card (expansion) can be a pain.
