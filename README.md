A minimal Chrome extension that adds one-click “copy card info” buttons to the Cardmarket website, letting you export the exact contents  want list as plain text.
| Feature             | Where it appears                                       | What it copies                                                                |

| **“Copy All”**      | Next to the **“Add to list”** button on any table view | Every card in the list in the format:`<Amount> <Card Name> (<Expansion>)`     |
| **Row-by-row copy** | Right next to the trash-can icon on each row           | The same single-line format for just that card                                |
